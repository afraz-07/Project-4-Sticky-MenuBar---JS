        Neon tetra fish (Paracheirodon innesi) are a popular freshwater fish species that are native to the Amazon basin
        in South America. They are small and peaceful, making them an excellent choice for community
        aquariums.Appearance:
        Neon tetras are known for their vibrant colors, which include a bright blue stripe that runs horizontally along
        their body, and a bright red stripe that runs just below it. The rest of their body is silver in color. They are
        relatively small, reaching a maximum size of around 1.5 inches (4 cm) in length.




        Diet:
        Neon tetras are omnivores, meaning they eat both plant and animal matter. In the wild, they feed on small
        insects, crustaceans, and plant matter. In captivity, they can be fed a variety of foods, including flakes,
        pellets, frozen or live foods such as brine shrimp, daphnia, and bloodworms.

        Behavior:
        Neon tetras are a peaceful and social species that are best kept in groups of at least six individuals. They are
        active swimmers, but also enjoy hiding in plants and other structures. They are generally compatible with other
        peaceful community fish, but should be kept away from larger or more aggressive species that may view them as
        food.

        Breeding:
        Breeding neon tetras in captivity can be challenging, but it is possible with the right conditions. A separate
        breeding tank with soft, acidic water, and a temperature range of 75 to 82 degrees Fahrenheit (24 to 28 degrees
        Celsius) is required. Spawning usually occurs in the early morning, and the eggs are adhesive and will stick to
        plants or other surfaces. The parents should be removed after spawning to prevent them from eating the eggs or
        fry.

        In conclusion, neon tetras are a popular and beautiful species of freshwater fish that are relatively easy to
        care for. They make a great addition to a community aquarium and are a great choice for beginner aquarists. With
        proper care and attention, these colorful fish can live for several years in captivity.
